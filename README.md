## I'm working toward a future built on Bitcoin.
**I help founders on the same mission solve hard commercial problems—positioning, sales process, channel strategy, revenue operations.**

Previously: Amboss, NYDIG Payments, Bottlepay.

### Building

- **[Trust Atlas](https://github.com/trustrevolution/trustatlas)** — Open data measuring trust across 200+ countries ([trustatlas.org](https://trustatlas.org))
- **[nostr-ux-patterns](https://github.com/shawnyeager/nostr-ux-patterns)** — Evidence-informed UX patterns for Nostr apps ([nostr-ux.com](https://nostr-ux.com))
- **[hearsay](https://github.com/shawnyeager/hearsay)** — Turn customer interview transcripts into product roadmap recommendations
